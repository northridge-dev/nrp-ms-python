# Python List, Continued

## Instructions

1. Read each code snippet
2. Predict what it will output → write your prediction
3. Type out the code and run it → write the actual output
4. If your prediction was wrong, try to figure out why

Once you're finished, answer the questions at the end.

# Questions

1. What is returned when, instead of a single number, you include two numbers separated by a colon colon (`:`) inside index brackets?
   <br>

2. What does the number _before_ the colon signify?
   <br>

3. What does the number _after_ the colon signify?
   <br>

4. What happens if:
   - you leave out the number before the colon?
   - you leave out the number after the colon?
     <br>

5. What happens if the start and end numbers are the same (for example, `[2:2]`)?
   <br>

6. What does the keyword `in` check for when used with a list?
   <br>

7. Explain why you got the output you did for Snippet 11.
