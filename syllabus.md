# **Middle School Coding: Python**

## **Course Details**

[Northridge Prep](https://northridgeprep.org/), Fall 2025  
Dr. Nicholas Kruckenberg (nkruckenberg@northridgeprep.org)

## **Course Description**

Introduces students to foundational computer programming concepts and computational thinking practices by completing coding exercises and small projects in Python.

Example projects:

- Pig Latin translator
- GCF calculator
- dice roll & coin flip simulators
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Quick Draw
- Blackjack
- Etch-a-Sketch
- The Great Snail Race
- Pong
- text-based RPG
- Battleship

## **Goals**

You will:

1. learn a little about how computers work and how your code programs them.
2. practice reading code and analyzing what it does.
3. write some non-trivial programs in Python.
4. build your problem-solving muscles in designing and implementing your programs.
5. exercise perseverance in debugging your programs.
6. practice communicating technical concepts.

Put another way, by the end of the course, you should be able to:

- write an interesting program in Python,
- understand how it works,
- and explain how it works to a friend.

## **Grades**

Grades will be assigned according to the Northridge grading scale and comprised of the following equally-weighted components:

1. self-control, diligence, perseverance, and organization (daily)
   - comes to class on time and prepared
   - works steadily and stays focused
   - shows perseverance and resourcefulness when facing problems
2. in-class exercises and projects (approx. one to three per week)
3. quizzes (approx. every week or two)

## **Responsibilities**

It is your responsibility to:

- Be in your seat and ready to work when the bell rings.
- Bring your well-organized binder, paper, and a pencil or pen to class each day.
- Be attentive and work diligently.
- Be resourceful and persevering. It pays to sit with a problem. Form and test hypotheses, debug your program, read the docs and consult sources, ask questions, but _don’t give up or wait around for someone else to solve your problems_.
- Follow the Responsible Use of Technology policy (below).
- If you’re absent:
  - consult the Northridge Dev course log
  - talk to me to arrange make-up work
  - get notes from a classmate.

## **Tools**

- a binder or folder to organize and keep notes, assignments, and quizzes
- loose-leaf paper or a notebook
- pen or pencil

## **Responsible Use of Technology**

Follow the Computer and Network Technology policy in the student handbook. If you need to hide your screen, switch tabs or windows, or clear your browser history, you're falling short of the mark.

## **Use of Artificial Intelligence**

AI is already a widely-adopted productivity tool in software development. We will practice using AI as a _learning_ tool, exploring ways it can help and hinder those learning to code.
